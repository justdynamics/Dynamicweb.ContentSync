### v1.2 Admin UI (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make ContentSync configurable from the DynamicWeb admin UI with query-based predicate management and ad-hoc serialize/deserialize via context menus.

- [ ] **Phase 7: Config Infrastructure + Settings Tree Node** - Concurrency-safe config read/write and nav node registration in DW admin tree
- [ ] **Phase 8: Settings Screen** - Admin UI for editing OutputDirectory, dry-run, logging level, and conflict strategy
- [ ] **Phase 9: Predicate Management** - CRUD list/edit screens for predicate configuration
- [ ] **Phase 10: Context Menu Actions** - Serialize-to-zip and deserialize-from-zip on content tree page nodes

## Phase Details

### Phase 7: Config Infrastructure + Settings Tree Node
**Goal**: Config file operations are concurrency-safe and the Sync node is visible in the DW admin navigation tree
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (v1.1 codebase)
**Requirements**: CFG-01, CFG-02, CFG-03, UI-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Two concurrent config writes (e.g., UI save during a scheduled task run) do not corrupt the config file
  2. A manual edit to ContentSync.config.json is reflected on the next admin UI screen load without restart
  3. Saving an invalid config value (e.g., empty OutputDirectory) shows a clear error message rather than silently writing bad config
  4. A "Sync" node appears under Settings > Content in the DW admin navigation tree and clicking it loads a screen (not a 404)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Config infrastructure: ConfigWriter, ConfigPathResolver, and tests
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Admin UI tree node registration and skeleton edit screen

### Phase 8: Settings Screen
**Goal**: Users can view and edit all ContentSync configuration options from the DW admin UI
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: UI-02, UI-03, UI-04, UI-05, UI-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can view and change the OutputDirectory path from the settings screen
  2. User can toggle dry-run mode on/off from the settings screen
  3. User can select a logging level and a conflict strategy from dropdown controls on the settings screen
  4. Clicking Save persists all changes to ContentSync.config.json, and reloading the screen shows the saved values
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Config model expansion (DryRun, ConflictStrategy) + full settings screen with dropdowns and validation

### Phase 9: Predicate Management
**Goal**: Users can manage content sync predicates (add, view, edit, delete) from the DW admin UI
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: PRED-01, PRED-02, PRED-03, PRED-04, PRED-05, PRED-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A "Predicates" sub-node appears under the Sync node in admin navigation and opens a list screen
  2. User can view all configured predicates showing their name, path, and include/exclude status
  3. User can add a new predicate, edit an existing predicate, and delete a predicate from the list screen
  4. All predicate changes (add, edit, delete) persist to ContentSync.config.json and survive a screen reload
  5. Predicates added via the admin UI are respected by the next scheduled task serialization run
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Predicate data layer: models, queries, commands, ConfigLoader zero-predicates fix, and tests
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — List screen, edit screen with page/area selectors, tree node wiring, and breadcrumb

### Phase 10: Context Menu Actions
**Goal**: Users can serialize page subtrees to downloadable zips and deserialize uploaded zips into the content tree via right-click context menu
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (uses config infrastructure; architecturally independent of Phases 8-9)
**Requirements**: ACT-01, ACT-02, ACT-03, ACT-04, ACT-05, ACT-06, ACT-07, ACT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Right-clicking a page in the content tree shows both "Serialize" and "Deserialize" context menu actions
  2. Clicking Serialize produces a zip of the page subtree as YAML and triggers a browser download
  3. The serialize zip is also saved to a configurable location on disk
  4. Clicking Deserialize prompts for a zip upload, lets the user choose overwrite-node or import-as-subtree, and applies the content to the tree
  5. Context menu actions reuse the existing ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer without duplicating serialization logic
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01-PLAN.md — ExportDirectory config field + SerializeSubtreeCommand (zip creation, download, disk copy)
- [ ] 10-02-PLAN.md — DeserializePromptScreen (file upload + mode select modal) + DeserializeSubtreeCommand
- [ ] 10-03-PLAN.md — ContentSyncPageListInjector (context menu wiring) + human verification
