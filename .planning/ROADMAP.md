### v1.2 Admin UI (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make ContentSync configurable from the DynamicWeb admin UI with query-based predicate management and ad-hoc serialize/deserialize via context menus.

- [ ] **Phase 7: Config Infrastructure + Settings Tree Node** - Concurrency-safe config read/write and nav node registration in DW admin tree
- [ ] **Phase 8: Settings Screen** - Admin UI for editing OutputDirectory, dry-run, logging level, and conflict strategy
- [ ] **Phase 9: Predicate Management** - CRUD list/edit screens for predicate configuration
- [x] **Phase 10: Context Menu Actions** - Serialize-to-zip and deserialize-from-zip on content tree page nodes (completed 2026-03-22)

### v1.3 Permissions

**Milestone Goal:** Serialize and deserialize page-level permissions so that access controls are preserved across environments, with a safety fallback for missing user groups.

- [x] **Phase 11: Permission Serialization** - Extend ContentMapper/SerializedPage to include explicit page permissions in YAML (completed 2026-03-22)
- [x] **Phase 12: Permission Deserialization + Docs** - Extend ContentDeserializer to restore permissions with group-name resolution and safety fallback (completed 2026-03-23)

## Phase Details

### Phase 7: Config Infrastructure + Settings Tree Node
**Goal**: Config file operations are concurrency-safe and the Sync node is visible in the DW admin navigation tree
**Depends on**: Phase 6 (v1.1 codebase)
**Requirements**: CFG-01, CFG-02, CFG-03, UI-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Two concurrent config writes (e.g., UI save during a scheduled task run) do not corrupt the config file
  2. A manual edit to ContentSync.config.json is reflected on the next admin UI screen load without restart
  3. Saving an invalid config value (e.g., empty OutputDirectory) shows a clear error message rather than silently writing bad config
  4. A "Sync" node appears under Settings > Content in the DW admin navigation tree and clicking it loads a screen (not a 404)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Config infrastructure: ConfigWriter, ConfigPathResolver, and tests
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Admin UI tree node registration and skeleton edit screen

### Phase 8: Settings Screen
**Goal**: Users can view and edit all ContentSync configuration options from the DW admin UI
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: UI-02, UI-03, UI-04, UI-05, UI-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can view and change the OutputDirectory path from the settings screen
  2. User can toggle dry-run mode on/off from the settings screen
  3. User can select a logging level and a conflict strategy from dropdown controls on the settings screen
  4. Clicking Save persists all changes to ContentSync.config.json, and reloading the screen shows the saved values
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md — Config model expansion (DryRun, ConflictStrategy) + full settings screen with dropdowns and validation

### Phase 9: Predicate Management
**Goal**: Users can manage content sync predicates (add, view, edit, delete) from the DW admin UI
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: PRED-01, PRED-02, PRED-03, PRED-04, PRED-05, PRED-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A "Predicates" sub-node appears under the Sync node in admin navigation and opens a list screen
  2. User can view all configured predicates showing their name, path, and include/exclude status
  3. User can add a new predicate, edit an existing predicate, and delete a predicate from the list screen
  4. All predicate changes (add, edit, delete) persist to ContentSync.config.json and survive a screen reload
  5. Predicates added via the admin UI are respected by the next scheduled task serialization run
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md — Predicate data layer: models, queries, commands, ConfigLoader zero-predicates fix, and tests
- [x] 09-02-PLAN.md — List screen, edit screen with page/area selectors, tree node wiring, and breadcrumb

### Phase 10: Context Menu Actions
**Goal**: Users can serialize page subtrees to downloadable zips and deserialize uploaded zips into the content tree via right-click context menu
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (uses config infrastructure; architecturally independent of Phases 8-9)
**Requirements**: ACT-01, ACT-02, ACT-03, ACT-04, ACT-05, ACT-06, ACT-07, ACT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Right-clicking a page in the content tree shows both "Serialize" and "Deserialize" context menu actions
  2. Clicking Serialize produces a zip of the page subtree as YAML and triggers a browser download
  3. The serialize zip is also saved to a configurable location on disk
  4. Clicking Deserialize prompts for a zip upload, lets the user choose overwrite-node or import-as-subtree, and applies the content to the tree
  5. Context menu actions reuse the existing ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer without duplicating serialization logic
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — ExportDirectory config field + SerializeSubtreeCommand (zip creation, download, disk copy)
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — DeserializePromptScreen (file upload + mode select modal) + DeserializeSubtreeCommand
- [ ] 10-03-PLAN.md — ContentSyncPageListInjector (context menu wiring) + human verification

### Phase 11: Permission Serialization
**Goal**: Explicit page permissions (roles and user groups) are captured in YAML alongside page data so permission state is version-controlled
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (v1.2 codebase)
**Requirements**: PERM-01, PERM-02, PERM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A page with explicit permissions serializes a permissions section in its YAML file listing each role/group with its permission level
  2. Roles are stored by name (e.g., "Anonymous", "AuthenticatedFrontend") and user groups are stored by group name — no numeric IDs in the YAML
  3. A page with no explicit permissions (inheriting from parent) produces no permissions section in its YAML file
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — SerializedPermission DTO, PermissionMapper, ContentMapper/ContentSerializer wiring, and unit tests

### Phase 12: Permission Deserialization + Docs
**Goal**: Permissions from YAML are restored on the target environment with name-based resolution and a safety fallback that prevents accidental public exposure
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: PERM-04, PERM-05, PERM-06, PERM-07, PERM-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Role-based permissions (Anonymous, AuthenticatedFrontend, etc.) are restored on deserialize by matching role name on the target
  2. User group permissions are resolved by group name on the target environment and applied with the correct permission level
  3. When a referenced user group does not exist on the target, Anonymous access is set to None (deny) and the event is logged as a safety fallback
  4. Deserialization logs every permission action: applied, skipped, and safety fallback triggered
  5. README documents the permission handling behavior including the safety fallback for missing groups
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — PermissionMapper.ApplyPermissions + ContentDeserializer wiring with safety fallback
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — README Permissions section documenting serialization, resolution, and safety fallback
