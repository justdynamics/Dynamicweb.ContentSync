# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move DynamicWeb database state between environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 23 - Full Page Properties + Navigation Settings

## Current Position

Phase: 25 (3 of 3 in v0.4.0 milestone)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-04-03

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v0.4.0)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20 (prior milestones)
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: ~1.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| (prior milestones) | 20 | ~80min | ~4min |
| 19 | 1 | 3min | 3min |
| 20 | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 21 | 1 | 3min | 3min |
| 22 | 1 | 1min | 1min |
| 23 | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 5min, 2min, 3min, 1min, 3min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 23 P02 | 5min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 24 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 25 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Sub-objects (Seo, UrlSettings, Visibility) always serialized; NavigationSettings only when UseEcomGroups=true
- Allowclick/Allowsearch/ShowInSitemap/ShowInLegend default to true on DTO matching DW field initializers
- ActiveFrom/ActiveTo as nullable DateTime to distinguish unset from explicit
- All ~30 page properties have public setters, flow through SavePage -- no special API needed
- PageNavigationSettings is inline columns on Page table, not separate entity
- Area ItemType uses standard Item.SerializeTo()/DeserializeFrom() pattern
- InternalLinkResolver already exists from v0.3.1 -- reuse for ShortCut and ProductPage links
- Timestamps deferred to future milestone (requires direct SQL post-save)
- No backward compatibility needed (beta)
- Sub-object DTOs for logical groupings (SEO, URL settings, visibility, navigation) to keep YAML clean
- [Phase 23]: EcommerceNavigationParentType enum is in Dynamicweb.Content namespace (not Ecommerce.Navigation)
- [Phase 24]: Area ItemType uses standard Item.SerializeTo/DeserializeFrom pattern; ItemType not set on target (must be pre-configured)

### Pending Todos
