# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move DynamicWeb database state between environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 13 — provider-foundation-sqltableprovider-proof

## Current Position

Phase: 13 (provider-foundation-sqltableprovider-proof) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: ~1.4 hours

**By Phase:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer internals remain unchanged — ContentProvider is a thin adapter
- [v2.0]: SqlTableProvider driven by DataGroup XML metadata (Table, NameColumn, CompareColumns)
- [v2.0]: FK ordering via topological sort from sys.foreign_keys
- [v2.0]: Rename isolated as final phase to avoid concurrent breakage with feature work
- [Phase 13]: ProviderDeserializeResult separate from content DeserializeResult to avoid coupling
- [Phase 13]: Dictionary keys preserved as-is in YAML (not camelCased) for SQL table serialization

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 10]: ScreenInjector target type for content tree page list is unknown — needs assembly inspection
- [Phase 13]: FK constraint enforcement level (SQL Server vs application-layer) needs runtime validation
- [Phase 16]: DW asset management extension point for file detail screen injector needs verification
