# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move content between DynamicWeb environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 — permission-deserialization-docs

## Current Position

Phase: 12
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: ~1.4 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2]: Config file remains source of truth — admin UI reads/writes JSON, no DB tables
- [v1.2]: Context menu actions reuse ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer via temp SyncConfiguration
- [Phase 10-02]: Override GetEditorForCommand for FileUpload and Select binding in PromptScreenBase
- [Phase 11-01]: PermissionMapper does I/O (PermissionService + UserManagementServices), ContentMapper stays pure
- [Phase 11-01]: Used UserManagementServices.Users.GetUserById instead of deprecated User.GetUserByID
- [Phase 12]: Lazy group name cache built on first ApplyPermissions call, reused across pages
- [Phase 12]: Permissions section placed between Content Model and Configuration in README for logical flow

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 10]: ScreenInjector target type for content tree page list is unknown — needs assembly inspection
