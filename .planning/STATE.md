# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move content between DynamicWeb environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Configuration

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 5 (Serialization)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-19 — Phase 3 Plan 01 complete (recursive page hierarchy and INF-03 long-path tests)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 24%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 10min | 5min |
| 02-configuration | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: foundation P01 (6min), foundation P02 (4min), configuration P01 (2min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 14 files |
| Phase 01-foundation P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02-configuration P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 03-serialization P01 | 8min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: YAML over JSON/XML for content files — readability and git-friendly diffs
- [Init]: GUID as canonical identity — numeric IDs differ per environment
- [Init]: Source-wins conflict strategy — serialized files always overwrite DB
- [Init]: Full sync via scheduled tasks — notifications deferred to v2
- [Research]: Config file should use JSON (not YAML) to avoid indentation ambiguity in machine-written config
- [Research]: Do NOT serialize DW model objects directly — always map to plain C# DTOs first
- [Phase 01-foundation]: ForceStringScalarEmitter: DoubleQuoted for CRLF strings (Literal normalizes \r\n to \n per YAML spec)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Literal block style only for LF-only multiline strings; DoubleQuoted is safe default for tilde, bang, empty, CRLF
- [Phase 01-foundation]: OmitEmptyCollections on private _fileSerializer (not shared YamlConfiguration) so page.yml/area.yml omit empty child-collection keys without affecting other consumers
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Paragraphs written flat in grid-row folder; ReadTree restores all to first column — multi-column paragraph attribution deferred to later phase
- [Phase 02-configuration]: Raw nullable model for JSON deserialization before validation — produces clear field-named error messages instead of generic JsonException
- [Phase 02-configuration]: Path boundary via starts-with-slash prevents partial prefix matches (e.g., /Customer Center2 does not match /Customer Center)
- [Phase 02-configuration]: OrdinalIgnoreCase for all predicate path comparisons — case-insensitive, culture-neutral
- [Phase 02-configuration]: ContentPredicateSet as peer class in ContentPredicate.cs for OR aggregate logic across multiple predicates
- [Phase 03-serialization]: Children stored as nested subfolders rather than YAML arrays — keeps page.yml diff-friendly and consistent with existing folder structure
- [Phase 03-serialization]: Per-level usedNames HashSet for sibling deduplication — siblings share a namespace per parent, not globally
- [Phase 03-serialization]: SafeGetDirectory falls back to 8-char GUID folder name when parent path exceeds 247 chars — prevents ArgumentOutOfRangeException on extreme nesting

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Reference field inventory (which DW fields store numeric cross-item references) is undocumented — must be discovered empirically during implementation
- [Phase 4]: DW transaction support across PageService/GridService/ParagraphService save calls is unverified — must check before designing the write loop atomicity strategy
- [Phase 4]: `GetParagraphsByPageId` active/inactive behavior is forum-documented only (MEDIUM confidence) — verify with a test page before designing deserialization completeness logic
- [Phase 2/5]: Whether DW injects IConfiguration into scheduled task addins is unverified — check at implementation time; affects whether Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json is needed
