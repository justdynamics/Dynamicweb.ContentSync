# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move content between DynamicWeb environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — predicate-management

## Current Position

Phase: 10
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 12
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: ~1 hour

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 10min | 5min |
| 02-configuration | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| 03-serialization | 3 | 13min | 4min |
| 04-deserialization | 2 | 5min | 3min |
| 05-integration | 2 | 13min | 7min |
| 06-robustness | 2 | 7min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: integration P01 (8min), integration P02 (5min), robustness P01 (3min), robustness P02 (4min)
- Trend: Stable

| Phase 07 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 07 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 8 files |
| Phase 08 P01 | 10min | 2 tasks | 12 files |
| Phase 09 P01 | 4min | 1 tasks | 10 files |
| Phase 09-predicate-management P02 | 2min | 1 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 Research]: Config file remains source of truth — admin UI reads/writes JSON, no DB tables
- [v1.2 Research]: Single NuGet addition (Dynamicweb.Content.UI 10.23.9) provides full UI framework
- [v1.2 Research]: Context menu actions reuse ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer via temp SyncConfiguration
- [v1.2 Research]: ReaderWriterLockSlim + file locking for config concurrency (in-process only)
- [v1.2 Research]: Index-based predicate identity (no DB-assigned IDs)
- [Phase 07]: Atomic write uses temp+rename pattern for crash safety
- [Phase 07]: CamelCase JSON output matches existing ConfigLoader expectations
- [Phase 07]: Used FileProviders.Embedded 8.0.15 to match DW CoreUI transitive dependency
- [Phase 08]: Custom JsonConverter for .NET 8 enum kebab-case (JsonStringEnumMemberName is .NET 9+)
- [Phase 08]: ConflictStrategy as string on ViewModel, enum in config layer - Select editor uses string values
- [Phase 08]: ListBase nested types (ListOption, OrderBy) are in Dynamicweb.CoreUI.Editors.Inputs namespace
- [Phase 09]: ConfigPath override property on commands for test isolation without DW runtime
- [Phase 09-predicate-management]: SelectorBuilder.CreateAreaSelector with WithReloadOnChange for dependent page selector field reload

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 7]: AreasSection type parameter may place node at wrong level — needs runtime verification
- [Phase 10]: ScreenInjector target type for content tree page list is unknown — needs assembly inspection
- [Phase 10]: File upload mechanism in CoreUI modals is undocumented — may need custom API endpoint
- [Phase 10]: DownloadFileAction streaming vs buffering for large zips is undocumented
