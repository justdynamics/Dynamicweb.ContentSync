# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move content between DynamicWeb environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Admin UI — defining requirements

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-03-21 — Milestone v1.2 started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 10min | 5min |
| 02-configuration | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: foundation P01 (6min), foundation P02 (4min), configuration P01 (2min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 14 files |
| Phase 01-foundation P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02-configuration P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 03-serialization P01 | 8min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 03-serialization P02 | 5min | 2 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 04-deserialization P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 04-deserialization P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 05-integration P01 | 8min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 05-integration P02 | 5min | 1 task | 1 file |
| Phase 06 P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 06 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 5 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: YAML over JSON/XML for content files — readability and git-friendly diffs
- [Init]: GUID as canonical identity — numeric IDs differ per environment
- [Init]: Source-wins conflict strategy — serialized files always overwrite DB
- [Init]: Full sync via scheduled tasks — notifications deferred to v2
- [Research]: Config file should use JSON (not YAML) to avoid indentation ambiguity in machine-written config
- [Research]: Do NOT serialize DW model objects directly — always map to plain C# DTOs first
- [Phase 01-foundation]: ForceStringScalarEmitter: DoubleQuoted for CRLF strings (Literal normalizes \r\n to \n per YAML spec)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Literal block style only for LF-only multiline strings; DoubleQuoted is safe default for tilde, bang, empty, CRLF
- [Phase 01-foundation]: OmitEmptyCollections on private _fileSerializer (not shared YamlConfiguration) so page.yml/area.yml omit empty child-collection keys without affecting other consumers
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Paragraphs written flat in grid-row folder; ReadTree restores all to first column — multi-column paragraph attribution deferred to later phase
- [Phase 02-configuration]: Raw nullable model for JSON deserialization before validation — produces clear field-named error messages instead of generic JsonException
- [Phase 02-configuration]: Path boundary via starts-with-slash prevents partial prefix matches (e.g., /Customer Center2 does not match /Customer Center)
- [Phase 02-configuration]: OrdinalIgnoreCase for all predicate path comparisons — case-insensitive, culture-neutral
- [Phase 02-configuration]: ContentPredicateSet as peer class in ContentPredicate.cs for OR aggregate logic across multiple predicates
- [Phase 03-serialization]: Children stored as nested subfolders rather than YAML arrays — keeps page.yml diff-friendly and consistent with existing folder structure
- [Phase 03-serialization]: Per-level usedNames HashSet for sibling deduplication — siblings share a namespace per parent, not globally
- [Phase 03-serialization]: SafeGetDirectory falls back to 8-char GUID folder name when parent path exceeds 247 chars — prevents ArgumentOutOfRangeException on extreme nesting
- [Phase 03-serialization]: DLL reference over NuGet for Dynamicweb.Content: Dynamicweb.Core NuGet lacks Dynamicweb.Content namespace; DLLs copied from Swift2.1 bin as documented fallback
- [Phase 03-serialization]: Services.Xxx static accessor chosen over new XxxService() — canonical DW10 pattern
- [Phase 04-deserialization]: Entity<int>.ID has no public setter in DW10 — UPDATE paths must load existing DW object first, then mutate and re-save (not construct new Page() and set ID)
- [Phase 04-deserialization]: Post-save re-fetch required for ItemType fields on INSERT path — page.Item is null on new Page() before SavePage() persists to DB
- [Phase 04-deserialization]: Roundtrip integration tests: serialize first via ContentSerializer then deserialize — self-contained tests without pre-committed YAML fixtures
- [Phase 04-deserialization]: DeserializeScheduledTask returns !result.HasErrors (false on any write failure), mirrors SerializeScheduledTask return-on-error pattern
- [Phase 05-integration]: Dynamicweb NuGet 10.23.9 replaces both DLL HintPaths — single reference transitively provides Dynamicweb.Core; integration test csproj needs no explicit reference (flows via ProjectReference)
- [Phase 05-integration]: Count summary walks returned SerializedArea tree post-serialization — no signature changes to SerializePredicate or SerializePage
- [Phase 05-integration]: [Collection("ScheduledTaskTests")] for sequential execution — both tasks append to ContentSync.log in BaseDirectory, concurrent runs would corrupt log
- [Phase 05-integration]: Config placed at AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory for FindConfigFile() discovery (third candidate path, reliable across dotnet test CWD variations)
- [Phase 05-integration]: OPS-01 uses byte-exact file comparison — catches any encoding/line-ending divergence between task and direct ContentSerializer paths
- [Phase 06]: Console.Error.WriteLine for OutputDirectory warning (non-fatal, does not throw)
- [Phase 06]: Column-aware filenames paragraph-c{ColumnId}-{SortOrder}.yml prevent SortOrder collisions across columns
- [Phase 06]: ColumnId is int? (nullable) for backward compatibility - null defaults to first column on read-back

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Reference field inventory (which DW fields store numeric cross-item references) is undocumented — must be discovered empirically during implementation
- [Phase 4]: DW transaction support across PageService/GridService/ParagraphService save calls is unverified — must check before designing the write loop atomicity strategy
- [Phase 4]: `GetParagraphsByPageId` active/inactive behavior is forum-documented only (MEDIUM confidence) — verify with a test page before designing deserialization completeness logic
- [Phase 2/5]: Whether DW injects IConfiguration into scheduled task addins is unverified — check at implementation time; affects whether Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json is needed
