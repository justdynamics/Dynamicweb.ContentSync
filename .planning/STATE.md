# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Developers can reliably move content between DynamicWeb environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 — permission-deserialization

## Current Position

Phase: 11 (permission-serialization) — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 (done)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: ~1.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 10min | 5min |
| 02-configuration | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| 03-serialization | 3 | 13min | 4min |
| 04-deserialization | 2 | 5min | 3min |
| 05-integration | 2 | 13min | 7min |
| 06-robustness | 2 | 7min | 4min |
| 07-config-infra | 2 | 7min | 4min |
| 08-settings-screen | 1 | 10min | 10min |
| 09-predicate-mgmt | 2 | 6min | 3min |
| 10-context-menu | 2 | 4min | 2min |
| 11-permission-serialization | 1 | 7min | 7min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2]: Config file remains source of truth — admin UI reads/writes JSON, no DB tables
- [v1.2]: Context menu actions reuse ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer via temp SyncConfiguration
- [Phase 10-02]: Override GetEditorForCommand for FileUpload and Select binding in PromptScreenBase
- [Phase 11-01]: PermissionMapper does I/O (PermissionService + UserManagementServices), ContentMapper stays pure
- [Phase 11-01]: Used UserManagementServices.Users.GetUserById instead of deprecated User.GetUserByID

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 10]: ScreenInjector target type for content tree page list is unknown — needs assembly inspection
