# Requirements: Dynamicweb.ContentSync

**Defined:** 2026-03-21
**Core Value:** Developers can reliably move content between DynamicWeb environments through source control, with serialized YAML files as the single source of truth.

## v1.2 Requirements

Requirements for admin UI milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Config Infrastructure

- [ ] **CFG-01**: Config file read/write is concurrency-safe (file locking prevents corruption from simultaneous UI and scheduled task access)
- [ ] **CFG-02**: Admin UI reflects manual config file edits on next screen load (bidirectional sync)
- [ ] **CFG-03**: Config file validation produces clear error messages for invalid values

### Admin UI Settings

- [ ] **UI-01**: Sync node appears at Settings > Content > Sync in DW admin navigation tree
- [ ] **UI-02**: User can view and edit OutputDirectory from the settings screen
- [ ] **UI-03**: User can toggle dry-run mode from the settings screen
- [ ] **UI-04**: User can configure logging level from the settings screen
- [ ] **UI-05**: User can set conflict strategy from the settings screen
- [ ] **UI-06**: Settings changes persist to ContentSync.config.json on save

### Predicate Management

- [ ] **PRED-01**: Query sub-node appears under the Sync node in admin navigation
- [ ] **PRED-02**: User can view a list of configured predicates (name, path, include/exclude)
- [ ] **PRED-03**: User can add a new predicate with name, path, and include/exclude toggle
- [ ] **PRED-04**: User can edit an existing predicate
- [ ] **PRED-05**: User can delete a predicate
- [ ] **PRED-06**: Predicate changes persist to ContentSync.config.json

### Context Menu Actions

- [ ] **ACT-01**: Serialize action appears in page context menu in the content tree
- [ ] **ACT-02**: Serialize creates a zip of the page subtree at a temporary location (separate from main serialization tree)
- [ ] **ACT-03**: Serialize zip is available for browser download
- [ ] **ACT-04**: Serialize zip is also saved to a configurable location on disk
- [ ] **ACT-05**: Deserialize action appears in page context menu in the content tree
- [ ] **ACT-06**: Deserialize prompts user to upload a zip file
- [ ] **ACT-07**: Deserialize lets user choose: overwrite clicked node as parent, or import zip as subtree
- [ ] **ACT-08**: Context menu actions reuse existing ContentSerializer/ContentDeserializer logic (no code duplication)

## Future Requirements

### Publishing

- **PUB-01**: App published to NuGet registry with dynamicweb-app-store tag
- **PUB-02**: Tested across multiple content trees beyond Customer Center

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| DW Lucene query UI reuse for predicates | Impedance mismatch — predicates are path-based, not index queries |
| Real-time change detection | v2 feature — Notifications API deferred |
| Media/file serialization | Content structure only |
| Incremental/partial sync | Full sync only |
| Database-backed config storage | Config file is source of truth by design |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| CFG-01 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| CFG-02 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| CFG-03 | Phase 7 | Pending |

| UI-02 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| UI-03 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| UI-04 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| UI-05 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| UI-06 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| PRED-01 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| PRED-02 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| PRED-03 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| PRED-04 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| PRED-05 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| PRED-06 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| ACT-01 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| ACT-02 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| ACT-03 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| ACT-04 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| ACT-05 | Phase 10 | Pending |
